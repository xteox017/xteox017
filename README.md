### Hi there friends 👋

Who am I? 🤔❓

Management Engineer from the National University of Colombia and Full Stack Web Developer from Bootcamp academy @SoyHenry (Buenos Aires, Argentina), where through more than 800 hours of practice I have managed to deepen in a world that I am passionate about and I consider with an immense potential to improve our living conditions. 

I have acquired the ability to execute scalable, modularizable projects that facilitate teamwork. I also have the experience of having led my own company for more than 6 years, from which I highlight the resilience, the articulated work with a clear objective and the constant adaptation to change in order to maintain competitiveness. 🤸🌎🕵️

I am currently looking for opportunities that allow me to contribute in collaborative work environments, where I can contribute from my experience and at the same time continue learning. 🤓

I leave you my contact details, to participate in your project! 🚀🚀🚀
